// === Exercise 1 ===

// Look at the error you get, read it and it should tell you the issue...,
// sometimes, even your IDE can tell you what's wrong

// Below we create a week array with all days of the week.
// We then try to print the first day which is monday, execute the code and see what happens.

// === Exercise 3 ===
// This should echo ` "Debugged !" `, fix it so that that is the literal text echo'ed

$str = 'Debugged ! Also very fun';
echo substr($str, 0, 10);

new_exercise(4);
// === Exercise 4 ===
// Sometimes debugging code is just like looking up code and syntax...
// The print_r($week) should give:  Array ( [0] => mon [1] => tues [2] => wednes [3] => thurs [4] => fri [5] => satur [6] => sun )
// Look up whats going wrong with this code, and then fix it, with ONE CHARACTER!

foreach ($week as &$day) {
  $day = substr($day, 0, -3);
}

print_r($week);

new_exercise(5);
// === Exercise 5 === ARRAYPUSH & FOR LOOP
// The array should be printing every letter of the alphabet (a-z) but instead it does that + aa-yz
// Fix the code so the for loop only pushes a-z in the array

for ($letter = 'a'; $letter <> 'aa'; $letter++) {
